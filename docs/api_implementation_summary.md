# Fsynth API Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a high-level public API for the Fsynth library
following the "Proposal 1: Explicit Queue & Processor" design pattern. This API
provides a clean, user-friendly interface while maintaining the core principles
of Fsynth: separation of planning and execution, immutability, and comprehensive
error handling.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. API Design Documentation (`docs/design/api.md`)

- Comprehensive documentation of the public API
- Detailed descriptions of all components: Queue, Processor, Operations, and
  Results
- Design principles and error handling strategies
- Future extension considerations

### 2. Usage Examples (`docs/usage_examples.lua`)

- 9 detailed examples demonstrating various usage patterns:
  - Basic file operations
  - Building operations over time from different functions
  - Transactional operations with rollback
  - Best-effort execution
  - Dry run testing
  - Advanced options and checksumming
  - Queue inspection and manipulation
  - Error handling patterns
  - Custom execution strategies

### 3. API Implementation (`fsynth/api.lua`)

- **OperationQueue**: High-level queue with inspection and manipulation
  capabilities
  - `add()`, `get_operations()`, `clear()`, `size()`, `remove()`
- **ProcessorWrapper**: Simplified processor interface with execution models
  - Supports: standard, validate_first, best_effort, transactional
  - Dry run capability
  - Configurable logging levels
- **Results Object**: Comprehensive execution results with detailed logging
- **Operation Factories**: Clean factory functions for all operation types
  - `copy_file()`, `create_directory()`, `create_file()`, `symlink()`
  - `move_file()`, `delete_file()`, `delete_directory()`

### 4. Main Module Update (`fsynth/init.lua`)

- Updated to export the new high-level API as the primary interface
- Maintains access to internal components via `fsynth._internal` for advanced
  usage

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Explicit Queue Management**: Users create and manage queues explicitly,
   allowing operations to be added from different parts of an application before
   execution.

2. **Immutable Operations**: Once created, operations cannot be modified,
   ensuring predictable behavior.

3. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Multiple execution models provide
   flexibility in error handling strategies.

4. **Backward Compatibility**: Internal components remain accessible for
   advanced users who need lower-level control.

5. **Dry Run Support**: Built-in support for simulating operations without
   making actual filesystem changes.

## API Usage Pattern

```lua
local fsynth = require("fsynth")

-- Create a queue and add operations
local queue = fsynth.new_queue()
queue:add(fsynth.op.create_directory("project/src"))
queue:add(fsynth.op.create_file("project/README.md", "# My Project"))

-- Execute operations
local processor = fsynth.new_processor()
local results = processor:execute(queue, {
    model = "validate_first",
    dry_run = false
})

-- Check results
if results:is_success() then
    print("All operations completed successfully")
else
    for _, err in ipairs(results:get_errors()) do
        print("Error:", err.message)
    end
end
```

## Testing

### Initial Manual Testing

The implementation was verified with a test script that:

- Created a queue with multiple operations
- Performed dry run validation
- Executed real filesystem operations
- Successfully created directories and files with the specified content

### Comprehensive Spec Tests (`spec/fsynth/api_spec.lua`)

Created complete spec tests covering:

- **Queue Management**: Creation, adding operations, inspection, clearing,
  removal, error handling
- **Operation Factories**: All operation types (copy_file, create_directory,
  create_file, symlink, move_file, delete_file, delete_directory) with parameter
  validation
- **Processor Execution**:
  - Dry run mode validation
  - All execution models (standard, validate_first, best_effort, transactional)
  - Error handling and rollback
  - Results object with detailed logging and error reporting
- **API Accessibility**: Log module and internal components access

The tests focus on the API layer itself, using mock operations to verify that:

- The API correctly creates operations with the right parameters
- Queue management works as expected
- The processor is called with the correct configuration
- Results are properly formatted and returned

All 28 tests pass successfully.

## Next Steps

The core API is now complete and functional. Possible enhancements could
include:

- Additional operation types (chmod, chown, etc.)
- Progress callbacks for long-running operations
- Parallel execution support
- Operation dependencies and constraints
- Plugin system for custom operations
