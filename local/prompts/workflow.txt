Creaet a github ci workflow that runs the busted test suite.


It should run on latest ubuntu
os dependencies: lua5.4 , luarocks , and direnv
app dependencies install: 
   luarocks --tree ./.luarocks install --only-deps fsynth-0.1.0-1.rockspec


running : 
direnv allow && busted

these app dependencies never change, so we should have all  but the final running part cached. 
the test suite takes < 1s to run, hence, if properly cached, this workflow, afeter cache retrival should not take more than a couple of seconds.


Create the workflow, commit , push
Then use the gh client to verify your work as needed.
